## About TidyTuesday

`TidyTuesday` is a weekly social data project hosted and organized by the R4DS Data Science community. The overarching goal of TidyTuesday is to make learning to work with data easier by providing real-world datasets.

New data are posted every Monday morning. You can use these data to create a visualization, a model, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language. For more information on TidyTuesday, please see the [rfordatascience/tidytuesday github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).


## Data Viz

I'm using this as an opportunity to learn and practice some new things in R, especially data visualization. I'm not going to update every week, but I'll post code for the challenges I do complete. See below for some examples of figures I've created based on this challenge (all code is also contained in this github repo).
